OFFICE SPACE: My department was moved out of the basement a few years ago because of water and mold issues. I always wore covered rain shoes because there was usually standing water in many places in the basement when it rained, and I lined the bottom and back of my bookcases with heavy plastic just in case the water moved to my office. (Water always accumulated in the bathroom hallway (NE corner), then it began accumulating in the Gold Room (baseboards on the kitchen cabinets are rotted), and then started accumulating in the English office lobby and outside the stairwell (SW corner).) Dead animals tend to accumulate in the basement window wells. And the southeast corner of the basement (where the English office used to be) is definitely haunted. (Well, if not haunted, then definitely creepy.) CLASSROOMS: While the classroom furniture and projectors / apple TVs are functional and the building has character, classrooms are cramped and smelly. Projector screens cover what little chalk/ whiteboard space there is in each classroom. (McCormick 224 has very little whiteboard space.) The windows (even when closed) do not muffle any sounds from outside, so when maintenance is cutting the grass we cannot hear anything in the classrooms. The upstairs rooms are usually hot or cold, rarely comfortable. The industrial ceiling fans help somewhat, but they are really loud, so sometimes you have to choose between being hot or being able to hear each other. (The fans are also connected to the lights, so you cannot have the fans on if you turn off the lights so students can see the projector screen.) Some windows are broken, some do not open. Some windows rattle a lot when it's windy. CLASSROOM MAINTENANCE: When my office was in McCormick and I taught there everyday, I made sure each classroom had chalk/ whiteboard markers and the appropriate number of desks, and I changed the batteries in the clocks each fall (using the giant ladder in the upstairs classrooms), but no one seems to be monitoring the classrooms now. The clocks don't work, broken desks are shoved in closets rather than asking maintenance to fix them, etc. SUMMARY: The building is really dumpy. It needs either a major renovation or to be taken offline as an office/classroom building. And there needs to be a regular maintenance schedule for all classrooms on campus (not just cleaning, but replacing batteries, repairing and restoring desks, and ensuring appropriate supplies).",

I am grateful to have a teaching and practicing space, and am particularly grateful to the other residents who are now sharing their space with our department, and its students and faculty. 
The office space I have been assigned adequately houses two grand pianos for private studio instruction, and, with the addition of a number of shelves, most of my musical score library.  It lacks any closet space.
Due to a lack of other available spaces, my studio has to serve double duty as a partial digital keyboard lab.  It only contains four of eight possible student keyboards, and does not include the teacher console and keyboard.  With low enrollment in the music major this fall, it is not a problem.  If our increased recruiting efforts revitalize our numbers, it will be a problem.  In the spring, I am slated to teach a group piano class for non-majors.  This course was converted from a 2-credit 2-week course to a 2-credit 8-week course last spring.  It always fills up and runs a waiting list.  I had hopes of offering multiple sections of this class.  Will it no longer be allowed to run because only 4 students can enroll now?  I would hate not to be able to teach a popular course that is in my area of expertise.
Gray Center has a beautiful appearance--much more than Fuhr Hall--and could possibly become the new home of the music program.  For this to happen, we would need more student practice rooms with much better lighting.  With some acoustical treatment and redesign we could possibly convert the large storage-type rooms (109 and 113) into choral and band rehearsal rooms.
The soundproofing in the building is terrible.  The walls between 115 and 116 are so thin, I can hear every conversation going on next door.  In deference to my neighbors, I have taken to practicing on a digital instrument with the volume turned down when they are having meetings or phone conversations.
I would propose using 115 for my piano teaching studio (with 2 grand pianos, desk, filing cabinets, etc.) and converting 116 into an 8-piano keyboard lab which could double as a theory/ear-training teaching room.  This would move these classes and our music history courses to inhabit the same building. 
Rehearsing the choir in the atrium seemed like a great idea, but the afternoon sun and heat made the space very uncomfortable.  Using the chapel as a venue is okay, but it is too large a space for the students to hear themselves well.
The lack of a dedicated performing space is a very great concern with Gray Center.  The Lark is a nice but expensive venue.  We are not highlighting the great 9'Steinway our college owns. There is no warm-up space for performers.  Performers will have to move instruments and equipment into and out of the Lark.  Lesson time and rehearsal time in preparation for upcoming performances is extremely limited to access to the 
space. 
One final less tangible but real concern is what feels like a lack of the sense of community that our students, faculty, and staff had in Fuhr Hall.  I infrequently meet up with colleagues and infrequently run into music students in the new space.  Some students have taken to practicing in their rooms on digital keyboards because of the lack of practice space and/or sound proofing.",

Music thrives in spaces that are designed with our discipline in mind. When practice rooms, rehearsal halls, and performance areas are functional, they become hubs of creativity and collaboration. These spaces support productivity, foster community, and give us environments where we are proud to host students, colleagues, and community members.

Opportunities for Transformation
The future of Fuhr Hall, or a replacement facility, represents one of the greatest opportunities for transformation on campus. A dedicated music building has the potential to create innovative teaching and rehearsal environments, integrate modern technology for recording and streaming, and provide spaces where collaboration can flourish. Most importantly, a purpose-built performance venue would showcase the work of our students and faculty, elevate the visibility of the arts at Hastings College, and serve as a cultural gathering place for the wider community. Such a facility would strengthen recruitment and retention while signaling a clear institutional commitment to the arts.

Areas for Improvement
At present, our facilities for music are inadequate. Flooding and infrastructure issues in Fuhr Hall have severely compromised the building. Beyond that, many existing spaces lack proper acoustics, soundproofing, technology, and environmental conditions, which hampers effective teaching, learning, and performance. Without a dedicated performance space, students are limited in their ability to share their work in an environment that matches the quality of their effort and education. These challenges affect not only the student experience but also the reputation and strength of the program as a whole.",

Ideally, another turfed area or indoor turfed area would serve a lot of the teams on campus well. It would give students and coaches more flexibility with their schedules and hopefully eradicate 8-10 practice times which effect student participation on campus events a lot of the time. If it was an indoor facility, it will help outdoor sports with weather issues in the fall and spring. Turf would not only help football, soccer, but baseball and softball for indoor space to use. It would be extremely difficult to add another sport on campus that uses turf without having another turf option. It would not even have to be full field, however that would be preferred. The space could even be rented out for additional income as an indoor turf space for teams and users around the Hastings area.",

It also was able to house large collections in musical scores and recordings for a library to support the major.

The French Chapel is one of the most distinctive and beautiful buildings on campus. Its location and architectural character make it a meaningful gathering space, and with thoughtful renovation, it could serve as a performance venue that reflects both the quality of our music program and the cultural presence of Hastings College.

Opportunities for Transformation
The Chapel has strong potential to become the performance home for music. Significant acoustical treatment would be required to make the space suitable for concerts, ensuring clarity for both performers and audiences. Removing the existing stage area and replacing it with a larger stage and proscenium designed for large ensemble performance would transform the Chapel into a true concert hall. This would create a performance venue capable of hosting band, choir, and chamber music, while also providing a high-quality space for campus events and community gatherings. The Chapel’s distinctive architecture could give Hastings College a performance space that is both functional and inspiring.

Areas for Improvement
As it stands, the French Chapel is not designed for music performance. The acoustics are not controlled, the stage is undersized, and the existing configuration does not allow for large ensembles. Without renovation, the space cannot adequately serve the needs of the music program. Addressing these issues would elevate the Chapel from an attractive but limited venue into a signature performance space that enhances the student experience and highlights the importance of the arts on campus.",

I propose plants such as lavender, marigolds, and geraniums that repel mosquitos with their smell. This is a more natural way to repel mosquitoes around campus, making the campus prettier, and keeps the attraction of multiple pollinators.",

I appreciate that there are lots of shelves in my office for books. The classrooms are more of a challenge, as 224 is the only one that works for my classes, which typically have 20-25 students. Some rooms (such as 111) have odd layouts of technology and writing surfaces, and proposed changes have not been implemented. The HVAC is also a recurring issue, and the building is known for its microclimates. Recent work on the crumbling back steps and inaccessible main floor women's restroom were welcome improvements. The main hallway is a stop on tours, and it is a bit dismal. A student group is working on brightening up the space, but a fresh coat of paint and perhaps some improved lighting might also help make it feel more welcoming.",

College students are lazy and don't want to walk extra, like following the path all the way to the business building if that is their destination. Many campuses are using the “desired path,” which is what the students prefer to use. I think that having this path would be a lot better than having the grass being stepped on in the mud or snow, and ruining the grass’s integrity.",

The building is built and configured for those program's purposes (two large television studios with lighting grids and adjacent control rooms, small rooms for editing bays, and 4 rooms for radio control and talent). While most of the spaces in the building are no longer used as they were once intended, I believe we can still make use of the space to build and develop a successful visual media program. I do not believe Broadcasting and Journalism are good programs to invest in, so the two large studios will likely never be fully utilized again. Any program we provide can suffice with a much smaller space. 

I do not believe the Gray Center for Communication Studies serves the music program as a place for their forever home, but I have not seen any commitment from the administration to even remotely consider growing media academics at Hastings College. 

I have been an advocate for growing the academic program for the last 5 years, but it has seen less and less support and investment from the administration during that time. I believe it is time to decide if the institution wants to invest and commit to media education. If not, I recommend utilizing the studio spaces for other purposes.",

When this space was functional it was constantly uncomfortable, with outdated furniture, outdated decor, outdated hvac that left us with 90 degree temperatures during the summer and 40 degrees during the winter if we were lucky. The hot water did not work and was know to have not worked for over 20 years. The hvac also had this reputation. The newly renovated accessible bathroom was unusable as it was made too compact by the facilites, (not able to properly access toilet paper) and features the coldest temperatures in the building. The mold looming under the carpets, the mildew in the ceiling and walls, and mysterious water dripping from the ceiling made me feel unsafe and unwelcome in the building.",

Since the 2nd floor classrooms have been taken offline, our remaining two classrooms cannot accommodate our larger class sizes, often requiring us to teach elsewhere- this is problematic for our courses that have a lab component. Additionally, classrooms 113 and 116 have an awkward layout and the projectors are not centered in the rooms, leaving blind spots where students struggle to see the screen. Having alternative seating in these classrooms would also be very beneficial. The long rectangular tables take up a lot of space and are not easily rearranged to promote student engagement and collaboration. We are happy to make work what we have, but there are a few improvements that would make our learning space more effective and welcoming to our students.",

I also sent (at Camille's request) a follow up email to Stephanie O. about the Gray Center.  I have taught in this building since I came to HC in 1999 (except for a few years in Kiewit) so I know the Gray Center well and I appreciate it's function and beauty. There are some simple things that we can do to improve the look and function of the Gray Center (even as we are managing multiple users of the space with music now using the space).  Easy things...update furniture in the atrium, recover the benches in the hallway, clean the carpets (especially stained areas) throughout, put new photos in the frames and get them put back up (they were taken down over a year ago for painting). Big things..windows get condensation and trim should be restained. As far as space use...I like the OMC people but I don't think that they need to be housed in a student facing space and between COMM/POLS and music we could really use that space.  OMC never has students in that office area.  Can they be in a space that is more office oriented and we (the academic departments) can use that space.  We literally have professors in tiny little offices (Bob's is actually an old radio bay). The OMC office area used to be the COMM/media office area before we were moved to Kiewit for a few years.  OMC used to be in Kiewit since they don't really need to be ADA accessible like the student facing academic departments need to be.  Just a thought!  Thanks for considering these ideas.",

Since the media courses no longer have access to the full studio and an adequate computer lab in the Gray Center, I think utilizing space in JDAC would be more efficient. It would free up the larger spaces in the Gray Center for music and other programs. 

I would like to add, I don't believe the Gray Center is the best forever home for music, since the building was never intended for that kind of program, but I also understand space is at a premium.",

I appreciate the grounds crew's efforts to clear ice on campus, but the chemicals they use on the sidewalks cause chemical burns on my dogs' paws. I imagine this is true of any animals (wild or domestic) walking on campus. I am also concerned by the amount of insecticide sprayed regularly in buildings (usually around 4:30 or  5, when most people have gone home), and the chemicals used to maintain the grass. Has anyone done a study of the safety of all the chemicals dumped on campus? And do most employees know that their spaces are regularly sprayed with potentially dangerous chemicals? (I have run into the insecticide people spraying my office many times, but I don't remember anyone ever telling us about this.)",

I go to this building to practice in the practice rooms, have classes, hold recitals and meetings, and rehearse extremley frequently. In comparison to the other institutions that I have had the opportunity to perform there, this building has become outdated, the classrooms, and rehearsal spaces and halls need a new updated look, as well as the technology other institutions currently have that improve the quality of work the students produce. Fuhr Hall has had climate control issues, with the building being very cold in the winter and would love to see the future of Fuhr Hall be lively for future students who pursue music, as this was the place that I spent the most time in the past 4 years.",

The food in the dinning hall is a lot better but I wish there was more seating in the grill area, I felt that the renovations did not need to be as dramatic in this space. The change in furniture seemed unnecessary as we had revamped the lobby space the year prior, and now the booth style seating is bulky, unattractive, and uncomfortable to use. The gym feels the most inaccessible and unappreciated. Students worked hard to gain new and more equipment for that space just for it to be ripped out the space to be cut in half two years later. I wish the money used for these renovations, that from what I understand most students did not ask for, was put toward other more pressing issues like hvac.",

The Gray Center has strong potential as a home for music. The two large studio spaces work very well for band and choir rehearsals, providing the size and flexibility needed for large ensemble instruction. The classroom space is also excellent, offering a productive environment for teaching and collaboration. These strengths make the Gray Center an attractive candidate for renovation into a more fully realized music facility.

Opportunities for Transformation
With thoughtful renovation, the Gray Center could become a highly effective music facility. The most impactful changes would include soundproofing throughout the building to create acoustically appropriate learning and rehearsal environments, and reconfiguring the current office suites and computer lab into more traditional offices, faculty studios, and practice rooms. These adjustments would better align the building with the specific needs of a music program. The absence of a dedicated performance venue remains a gap, but renovation of the French Chapel could provide a beautiful and appropriate performance space, complementing the Gray Center’s strengths. Together, these renovations would create a comprehensive home for music at Hastings College.

Areas for Improvement
While the Gray Center already functions well in some respects, several issues limit its effectiveness as a music facility. The lack of soundproofing impacts both rehearsal and individual practice, creating challenges for teaching and concentrated work. Current office and computer lab layouts are inefficient for music and need to be reconfigured into private offices and practice spaces. Finally, without an on-site performance venue, the student experience remains incomplete, as rehearsals and performances are separated into different facilities. Addressing these areas would significantly improve both day-to-day learning and the public presentation of the program.",

The faculty does not seem to connect with each other, music students are lacking necessary spaces, and common areas such as the atrium, E-sports arena, and computer lab are currently homing more than what it was made for. While I am grateful that music has a home now that Fuhr Hall is offline, it seems that the overarching “vibe” of the building is off. The four practice rooms are quite dark, making it difficult to see music and puts a strain on the yes of musicians. Additionally, there seems to be a slight lack of communication within the many departments.",
